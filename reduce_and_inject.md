# Reduce, et. al.

`Reduce`, `inject`, `fold`, `accumulate`, `aggregate` and `compress`.[1] All
different names for the same *higher-order* function. Beginners and seasoned
programmers alike can get confused by its quirky syntax. But this isn't just an
article about **how** and **when** to use this nugget; I also want to convince
you that you **should** use it, and **why**.

## What's with the weird syntax?

If you aren't sure about how to use reduce, but have seen it in others' code,
you've probably wondered why they didn't use a simple and easier-to-read for
loop. If you're a seasoned developer comfortable with reduce and its cousins,
you at least remember that uneasy feeling you got when you first encountered
it.
